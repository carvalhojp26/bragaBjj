# BragaBjj

## Description
BragaBjj is my first project, aimed at creating a website for a Jiu-Jitsu association. The objective is to build an engaging and informative online presence for the association, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Through this project, I aim to apply foundational web development skills and create a platform that effectively represents the association's mission and community.
